         * Issue #99:
         * Before issue #99, bitWiseDeCompact was implemented as follows:
         *
         *     public static void bitWiseDeCompact(byte[] bits, byte[] input, int offset, int length)
         *     {
         *         int bitsToRead = 1;
         *         int bitsLeft = 8;
         *         int current;
         *         byte mask = 0x01;
         *
         *         int index = 0;
         *         for (int i = offset; i < offset + length; i++)
         *         {
         *             while (bitsLeft > 0)
         *             {
         *                 bitsLeft -= bitsToRead;
         *                 current = 0x01 & (input[i] >> bitsLeft);
         *                 bits[index++] = (byte) current;
         *             }
         *             bitsLeft = 8;
         *         }
         *     }
         *
         * The 4 variables declared at the beginning of this method takes 13 byte
         * footprint in stack. By reducing the footprint to 1 byte, this method can
         * be about 30% more efficient than the original implementation if length
         * parameter is 1.
         *
         * Besides,
         * for (int i = offset; i < offset + length; i++) {}
         * is more efficient than:
         * length += offset;
         * for (int i = offset; i < length; i++) {}
         *
         * The reason is that memory access/allocation is more expensive than calculations
         * in CPU registers. Not to mention that javac may have ways to optimize (offset +
         * length) in the loop condition.
         *
         * It is similar to the other three overrides of bitWiseDeCompact.
