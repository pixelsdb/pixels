            TERM signal at the same time. So that there is a case that:
            The first process receives the signal and terminates with the file lock released.
            After that but before the other process receives the signal, the other process
            obtains its partner's lock and restart its partner.
            In such a case, the main/guard daemons will not be terminated.
            To solve this problem, we make the process sleep 1 second before tries to start
            its partner. One second should be enough to send TERM signals to each daemon.
