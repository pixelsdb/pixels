# Pixels-Worker-Amphi

`pixels-amphi-worker` is the on-premises worker of `pixels-amphi` that aims at submitting queries to 
`pixels-server` and receiving the coordinator decision. According to the trade-offs in performance and computation costs, 
the coordinator either decide to execute the query in the cloud and send back the results, or execute the query 
locally with cached columnar data.

## Basic Functionalities

- Communicate with `pixels-server` in the cloud with gRPC. This project shares proto files with Pixels project.
See the protocol buffer files in the `proto` directory of this project for the definitions.
- Send SQL queries to the dialect transpilation service, and transpile the corresponding queries for both
in-cloud query engine (Trino) and on-premise query engine (DuckDB).
- Submit the transpiled query to the coordinator service, to receive either the 
exact query result from cloud compute, or instructed to perform on-premises execution.
- With the Columnar Cache Planner implemented in `benchmark/scripts/cache_algorithm.py`
and `pixels-amphi/downloader`, the worker can produce a cache plan and download Pixels data as parquet files.
- The worker runs DuckDB engine to create views on parquet files and perform the corresponding query.

## Dependencies

- `gRPC-1.54.0` and `protobuf` for communication with `pixels-server`
- `DuckDB-0.8.0` for on-premise in-process database
- `googletest-1.13.0` for unit testing
- `spdlog-1.11.0` for logging
- `yaml-cpp-0.7.0` for configuration
- `cli-2.0` for interactive cli
- `nlohmann_json-3.11.2` for parsing json files

## Quick start
```
>> make clean
>> make
... (Compiling the worker project and starting the cli)

>> cd build/tests
>> ./unit_tests
... (Performing unit tests)

>> cd build/benchmark
>> ./benchmark /path_to_worker_config /path_to_experiment_config
... (Running the benchmark experiment)
```

## Build with Docker

`Dockerfile` includes the configuration to run the worker in a docker container:
```
>> docker build -t worker .
... (Installing dependencies and creating docker image)

>> docker run -it worker
... (Running application in container)

root@aebf1e57cbe0:/pixels-worker-amphi# >> make
... (Building the CMake project)
