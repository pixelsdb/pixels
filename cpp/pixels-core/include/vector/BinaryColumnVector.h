/**
 * BinaryColumnVector derived from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.vector.
 * <p>
 * This class supports string and binary data by value reference -- i.e. each field is
 * explicitly present, as opposed to provided by a dictionary reference.
 * In some cases, all the values will be in the same byte array to begin with,
 * but this need not be the case. If each value is in a separate byte
 * array to start with, or not all the values are in the same original
 * byte array, you can still assign data by reference into this column vector.
 * This gives flexibility to use this in multiple situations.
 * <p>
 * When setting data by reference, the caller
 * is responsible for allocating the byte arrays used to hold the data.
 * You can also set data by value, as long as you call the initBuffer() method first.
 * You can mix "by value" and "by reference" in the same column vector,
 * though that use is probably not typical.
