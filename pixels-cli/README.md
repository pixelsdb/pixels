# Pixels Cli

This is the command-line tool for benchmark evaluations (e.g., TPC-H).
We can use it to load data from csv files into Pixels, copy the data, compact the small files,
collect data statistics, and run the benchmark queries.

It was previously named `pixels-load`.

## Usage

[TPC-H Evaluation](../docs/TPC-H.md) provides an example of using `pixels-cli`.
